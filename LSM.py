'''
Generally, there are several functions that need to run to make the LSM tree work:
Write Data
Read Data
Search Data
Compaction
Deletion

Helper functions may include:
Bloom filter
Sparse index

Each of these is defined below:

Write Data:
    When memtable reaches <arbitrary size>, write contents of memtable to disk in KEY-sorted order

Read Data:
    First we check the Bloom Filter to see if the KEY exists
    If NO: return "key does not exist"
    If YES: iterate from latest segment file to oldest, looking for MOST RECENT key:value pair

Search Data:
    First search for key:value in memTable
    If not present, search from most recent file backwards, since only the most recent key:value is relevant

Compaction:
Compare key:value pairs across segments and update to most recent value:
    1. If newest value is tombstone marker: delete key:value
    2. Write neweset segment to incldue most recent key:value pair
